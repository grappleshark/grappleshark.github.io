## Welcome to GrappleShark GitHub Pages

https://grappleshark.github.io/

This website is initially built to help the exploration of GitHub by our work experience students. The aim is for them to understand:

* How to build websites
* Create a github account
* How to create a repository
* How to add files
* How to create a branch
* How to make and commit changes
* Maybe open pull requests / merge if collaboration is required
* Deploy a webpage to their own username.github.io 
* Celebrate with pizzas

The aim is for work experience students to leave Development team with their own site, which they can continue to develop on.

And pizzas.

Tools:
* GitBash
* NotePad++
* VisualStudio
